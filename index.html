                            The purpose of this page is to showcase some concepts in computer programming using JavaScript syntax.
                            The reason in using JavaScript syntax is that JavaScript is a high-level language meaning that its syntax is understandable for humans, but 
                            you have less control over the hardware.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another purpose of this page is to try to see how many concepts I can remember and
                            how well I remember those concepts. This will also test how well I can articulate 
                            the ideas through writing down text. This page can be thought of as a review for me. 
                            I hope that by creating this page, I can get a feel about how comfortable I am with 
                            the most foundational programming concepts.

                            The explanations of the concepts on this page aim to be non-technical. This means that the goal is that someone with no prior 
                            knowledge on programming could understand the concepts that I will write. If you are clueless about programming and you leave 
                            this page learning a new concept then I consider that a win. It is said that to be truly knowledgeable on a subject you can 
                            teach that subject to others. Although I will only be covering foundational concepts, I wish to someday work towards creating 
                            a future page where I will go more indepth in more complex concepts and share the joys of learning.

                            The variables that you see in JavaScript are similar to the ones you see in math. 
                            They are used to substitute values without explicitly using said values. 
                            The names of variables are called "identifiers", and must follow certain rules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The name/identifier for a variable in JavaScript must start with either a letter, an underscore "_", or a dollar sign "$". 
                            The characters after the first one can contain the digits 0 to 9 and also include uppercase and lowercase 
                            characters from "a" to "Z". You can also use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in naming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here are some examples of legal identifiers: temp, color2, _weather, $variable2, and hello_world.

                        <p>
                            In order to "create" a variable you must first declare it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are four common ways to declare variables: 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can use the keyword var. For example,
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            var x = 2
                        </code>
                        <code></code>
                        <code></code>
                        <code></code>
                    </section>

                        <header>header 5</header>
                        <p></p>
                        <code></code>
                        <ul>
                            <li></li>
                            <li></li>
                            <li></li>
