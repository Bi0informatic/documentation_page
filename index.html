                            The purpose of this page is to showcase some concepts in computer programming using JavaScript syntax.
                            The reason in using JavaScript syntax is that JavaScript is a high-level language meaning that its syntax is understandable for humans, but 
                            you have less control over the hardware.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another purpose of this page is to try to see how many concepts I can remember and
                            how well I remember those concepts. This will also test how well I can articulate 
                            the ideas through writing down text. This page can be thought of as a review for me. 
                            I hope that by creating this page, I can get a feel about how comfortable I am with 
                            the most foundational programming concepts.

                            The explanations of the concepts on this page aim to be non-technical. This means that the goal is that someone with no prior 
                            knowledge on programming could understand the concepts that I will write. If you are clueless about programming and you leave 
                            this page learning a new concept then I consider that a win. It is said that to be truly knowledgeable on a subject you can 
                            teach that subject to others. Although I will only be covering foundational concepts, I wish to someday work towards creating 
                            a future page where I will go more indepth in more complex concepts and share the joys of learning.

                            The variables that you see in JavaScript are similar to the ones you see in math. 
                            They are used to substitute values without explicitly using said values. 
                            The names of variables are called "identifiers", and must follow certain rules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The name/identifier for a variable in JavaScript must start with either a letter, an underscore "_", or a dollar sign "$". 
                            The characters after the first one can contain the digits 0 to 9 and also include uppercase and lowercase 
                            characters from "a" to "Z". You can also use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in naming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here are some examples of legal identifiers: temp, color2, _weather, $variable2, and hello_world.
                        </p>

                    <section id="declaring-variables" class="main-section">
                        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
                        <p>
                            In order to "create" a variable you must first declare it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are four common ways to declare variables: 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can use the keyword "var". For example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            var x = 2;
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            This syntax of "var" can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By assigning a value to a identifier without any keywords, it can create a variable that is always
                            global. For example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            x = 2;
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Depending on the setup, this could generate a JavaScript error. This way of declaring variables 
                            should be avoided. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The keyword "let" is commonly used to declare variables whose values are subject to change. For example: 
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            let x = 2;<br><br>
                            x = 3;
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            The first line of code declares a new variable called "x" and assigns it the value of 2.
                            This means that every reference to "x" will automatically substitute "x" with 2.
                            The second line of code reassigns the variable "x" a new value of 3. Now every reference to "x" will result in a 3.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The last keyword I will be covering will be the keyword "const". For example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            const x = 2;
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            The "const" keyword lets the computer know that the value assigned to "x" must not be reassigned.
                            The following statement after the "const x = 2;" declaration would result in a JavaScript warning:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            x = 3;
                        </code>
                    </section>
                    <section id="scope" class="main-section">
                        <header>Scope</header>
                        <p>Scope is the name for where a variable lives. There are three types of scopes in JavaScript:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Block</li>
                            <li>Function</li>
                            <li>Global</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Variables declared in a {} block live only within the brackets. That means that you can only 
                            access those within the block or else an error occurs. For example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            {<br>
                                let x = 4 <span class="comment">// this is valid and x can be accessed here</span><br>
                            }<br>
                            <span class="comment">// console.log(x) would not work and would cause an error</span>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Variables that are declared within a function are in the local scope. It cannot be accessed outside of the function.
                            For example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <span class="blue">function</span> exampleFunction() {<br>
                                <pre>   </pre>
                                <span class="blue">let</span> variableName = <span class="green">"one"</span>
                                <span class="comment">// this can be accessed inside the function</span><br>
                            }<br>
                            <span class="comment">// console.log(variableName) would not work here and would throw an error</span>
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            Here are two reasons why local variables are used:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>they make memory management more efficient. Once the function ends, the space for the local variables is reallocated.</li>
                            <li>they reduce problems down the line when you want to name a variable, but the variables name is already taken. You might also forget that a variable is storing some other value that do you not need.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A variable declared outside of a function or a block is called global. This means that is can be accessed and referenced anywhere in the file. For example:</p>
                        <code>
                            <span class="blue">let</span> variableName = <span class="green">"one"</span>
                            <br><span class="comment">// variableName can be accessed here</span><br>
                            <span class="blue">function</span> exampleFunction() {<br>
                                <pre>   </pre><span class="comment">// variableName can also be accessed here</span><br>
                            }<br>
                            
                            
                        </code>
                    </section>
                </div>
            </div>
        </main>
