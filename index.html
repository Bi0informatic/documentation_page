                            The purpose of this page is to showcase some concepts in computer programming using JavaScript syntax.
                            The reason in using JavaScript syntax is that JavaScript is a high-level language meaning that its syntax is understandable for humans, but 
                            you have less control over the hardware.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another purpose of this page is to try to see how many concepts I can remember and
                            how well I remember those concepts. This will also test how well I can articulate 
                            the ideas through writing down text. This page can be thought of as a review for me. 
                            I hope that by creating this page, I can get a feel about how comfortable I am with 
                            the most foundational programming concepts.

                            The explanations of the concepts on this page aim to be non-technical. This means that the goal is that someone with no prior 
                            knowledge on programming could understand the concepts that I will write. If you are clueless about programming and you leave 
                            this page learning a new concept then I consider that a win. It is said that to be truly knowledgeable on a subject you can 
                            teach that subject to others. Although I will only be covering foundational concepts, I wish to someday work towards creating 
                            a future page where I will go more indepth in more complex concepts and share the joys of learning.
